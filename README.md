======================

Not even code, just another idea.

Basically, wouldn't it be cool if we could eliminate ISP's altogether?

With all the DMCA's and ISP's pushing for stuff like this:

It'd be nice to have a backup plan in case things go south and the internet as we know it dissappears entirely.

Basically, why can't we all just invest in better network hardware and make the internet just one big Wide Area Network
with no central authority, and all users using some sort of peer-to-peer technology to find paths to their data.
I mean, that's pretty much what routers already do, so why not just give them a little extra work?

Devices would just connect directly to one another, and route data through one another, and maybe we have
high-powered hubs or something whenever centralized sources of data can't be avoided.

Centralized data sources should be avoided, too.  Goddamn. Gnunet, freenet, shit like that exists,
we shouldn't be keeping our eggs in one big basket any government or powerful authority can get its hands on.
The only reason everyone, including myself unfortunatly, doesn't use those is because there isn't enough
faith in them, and those sorts of things need many users to thrive.  Othewise, they're just slow and useless.

There's no need to line the pockets of some dick over at verizon when we have such readily available network
technology to do the job ourselves.

Maybe I'm just a dumbass and this isn't practical for some reason beyond my understanding, but god dammit,
I don't want the internet to turn into Cable TV just because some crybabies at some large ISP don't want
to route packets they can't put a fee on.
